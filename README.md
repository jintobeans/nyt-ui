# New York Times Bestsellers

A simple user interface for browsing overviews of the New York Times Bestsellers

## Technologies Used:

* React

* React-Redux

* React Router DOM

* Express


## Objectives of the challenge:

* Build an intuitive user interface

* Make the UI responsive

* Avoid using any CSS frameworks

* Use SASS to write CSS better

* Be supported by all modern browsers

* Include tests for each component

* Write code that is as readable as possible

## Bugs:

* Moving API call to the backend does not currently work with jsonp

## Stretch Goals:

* Make JSONP API calls from the back end in order to protect security of API key

* Integrate other API calls (outside of 'Overview') from the NYT Books API with additional reducers
