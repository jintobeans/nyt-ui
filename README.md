# New York Times Bestsellers

## A simple user interface for browsing overviews of the New York Times Bestsellers

For this project, I used React to render components, React-Redux for overall state management, Express for serving the app, and jsonp for accessing data from the NYT Books Overview API that was given.

## Project Objectives:

* Build an intuitive user interface

* Make the UI responsive for all kinds of devices

* Avoid using any CSS frameworks

* Use SASS to write CSS better

* Be supported by all modern browsers

* Include tests for each component

* Write code that is as modular and readable as possible

## Bugs:

* Moving API call to the backend does not work with jsonp

## Stretch Goals:

* Make JSONP API calls from the back end in order to protect security of API key

* Integrate other API calls (outside of 'Overview') from the NYT Books API with additional reducers
